 @const	     SSYCarbonSearcherResultsKeyContainerChanged
 @brief    I'm not quite sure I understand this, so I quote from the documentation of PBCatalogSearch[A]Sync.  This is an NSNumber BOOL "indicating whether the container’s contents have changed. If true, the container’s contents changed since the previous PBCatalogSearchSync call. Objects may still be returned even though the container changed. Note that if the container has changed, then the total set of items returned may be incorrect; some items may be returned multiple times, and some items may not be returned at all."  I always thought that this simply meant that the disk was modified during the search, which happens frequently in any multitasking operating system.  A result of YES, I think, can usually be ignored unless you have some reason to believe that the "change" involved your search results.  If you want to be 100% sure your results are correct, you could re-run the search until this value is NO.  But since disks are changing all the time, is that really any better?

 @superclass  NSObject { }
 @brief    This class provides a class method for searching the startup disk for files matching a given name, returning paths.

 @details  This class uses Carbon's old File Manager.  PBCatalogSearch[A]Sync() does the actual work.  This is way faster than Unix 'find', but not as fast as a Spotlight search.  However it is more comprehensive than a Spotlight search because (1) user cannot exclude directories using Spotlight's Preferences, (2) it searches inside packages.  There may be other differences that I am not aware of.
 
 I believe this class should work at least down to Mac OS 10.3, but have not tested it in Mac OS 10.3.
 
 A unix command-line wrapper, CarbonSearch, and also a Cocoa application (windowless, prints to log), CarbonSearcherApp, are available to demonstrate the class and to use as a utility.

/*!
 @brief    Performs a synchronous or asynchronous search of the startup disk catalog, finding the full paths of files matching a given name

 @details  My apologies for having so many arguments, but believe me it's better than filling out a parameter block.  Much of the complication comes from the fact that the search is broken up into partial searches called "iterations".  This is necessary since the PBCatalogSearch[A]Sync() which does the actual work returns results in 'C' arrays which must be dimensioned to a finite size.  In other words, if there are many results you need to empty the bucket once in awhile.  This can be thought of as "feature" in that you can print partial results after each iteration.  In this implementation, partial results just get printed to the console.  If a non-NULL syncResults argument is provided, the search is performed synchronously (blocking the calling thread until the search is complete).  If syncResults is NULL, the method returns immediately after configuring and starting the search; the search is performed asynchronously (not blocking, using PBCatalogSearchAsync), and results are returned to the asyncCallbackTarget via the asyncCallbackSelector with for each iteration.  The asynchronous mode is recommended in applcations where it is undesirable to freeze the user interface.
 @param    searchString  filename, or part of a filename, to be searched for.
 @param    fullNameSearch  If YES, narrowly filters results to require that filenames match the entire searchString.  If NO, a partial match is sufficient.
 @param    findDirectories  If NO, directories will be excluded from results.  If findDirectories is NO, then findFiles must be YES or an exception will be raised.
 @param    findFiles  If NO, regular files will be excluded from results.  If findFiles is NO, then findDirectories must be YES or an exception will be raised.
 @param    maxFindsPerIteration  The maximum number of paths allowed to be found per iteration.  When this is reached, another iteration is started.
 @param    maxSecondsPerIteration  The maximum time in seconds allowed per iteration.  When this is reached, another iteration is started.
 @param    maxIterations  The maximum number of iterations allowed.  When this is exceeded, the search is aborted.
 @param    maxFindsGrandTotal  The maximum number of paths allowed to be found.  When this is exceeded, the search is aborted.
 @param    verbose  If YES, prints diagnostics to console
 @param    printResultsEachIteration  If YES, prints paths found after each iteration
 @param    syncResults  Should be a handle to an NSDictionary in which all results will be returned synchronously.  The dictionary entries are the keys SSYCarbonSearcherResultsKeyXXXXXX.  See "Constants" for a list of the keys and description of their values.  If either asyncCallbackTarget or asyncCallbackSelector are nil, the search is performed asychronously and this parameter is ignored.
 @param    asyncCallbackTarget  The object (NSObject) to which results messages will be sent, if searching asynchronously.  This argument is required to be non-nil if asyncCallbackSelector is not NULL.  Otherwise, it is ignored.
 @param    asyncCallbackSelector  The selector (method) via which results messages will be sent, if searching asynchronously.  This argument is required to be non-NULL if asyncCallbackTarget is not nil.  Otherwise, it is ignored.  This selector must take one argument, an NSDictionary*, and return an integer.  The NSDictionary will contain the SSYCarbonSearcherResultsKeyXXXX keys.  The integer returned should be one of the enumeration constants in SSYCarbonSearcherContinueStyle.
 @param    err_p  If you pass a pointer to an OSErr, on output it will point to the last OSErr value generated by File Manager functions.  Note that a value of -1417, indicating errFSNoMoreItems, is normal when the search is completed.
 @result   For an asynchronous search, returns YES if the search was initiated with no errors and NO otherwise.  For a synchronous search, returns YES if the search was completed with no errors and NO otherwise.
